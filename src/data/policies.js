AUDITDNA – PARTNER ACCESS POLICY DISCLOSURE

AuditDNA does not require an NMLS license, CPA license, or legal bar status to apply for partner access.

However, we reserve the right to grant or deny access to our platform to any applicant or entity. This policy exists to prevent misuse, solicitation, or predatory activity from individuals or firms operating outside of ethical bounds.

Our mission is to protect consumers. To that end:
- We reserve full discretion in determining partner eligibility.
- We enforce access restrictions on any party deemed to pose a risk to data integrity, consumer safety, or compliance standards.
- We do not tolerate abuse, fraud, or unauthorized solicitation on our network.

By applying for partner access, you acknowledge and agree to this discretionary policy.
