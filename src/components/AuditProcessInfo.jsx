        Audit Inquiry & Consumer Protection Process
      </h2>
      <p>
        <b>Recap:</b> When an audit inquiry is made, a ping will come back with
        the overcharge amount entitled by the consumer, then the title company
        is notified about it. Whatever the overcharge is fromÃ¢â‚¬â€medical,
        insurance, promissory note impound account from title services or
        mortgage servicing (note) company, etc.Ã¢â‚¬â€the title company will be
        informed. The system will provide them with the consumerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name,
        address, reimbursement creditor, etc., and escrow will manage the
        disbursement of funds to the consumer. AuditDNA and escrow will charge
        for their services too.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Process Details:</b> When a debt or overcharge is due to pay, the
        proper regulation authority needs to be notified in writing about it.
        This is the portion about protecting the consumer.
      </p>
      <p>
        A system must be set up to guard this information so the proper
        regulators can be notified immediately in writing about the overcharge
        by "X" company or business. The CFPB needs to be sent a letter
        immediately, and within the consent forms a consumer signs (assuming you
        have this information) grants us consent to bill, reassign the funds in
        their behalf from creditor payback to the escrow account for repayment
        and traceability.
