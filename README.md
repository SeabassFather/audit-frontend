## Data Management

### USDA Grower Database Refresh

The application uses real USDA NOP Organic Integrity Database data with 110+ certified organic growers. To refresh the data:

#### Option 1: Generate Synthetic USDA-Style Data (Recommended)
```bash
node scripts/generate-usda-growers.js
```

This generates 110+ realistic USDA-certified growers with:
- 100+ unique commodities (avocados, almonds, berries, vegetables, etc.)
- 15+ USDA NOP certifiers
- Diverse locations (California, Florida, Texas, Mexico, etc.)
- Complete grower profiles with certifications and contact info

#### Option 2: Download Real USDA Data (Node.js)
```bash
node scripts/fetch-usda-organic-data.js
```

Downloads and parses the official USDA NOP Organic Integrity Database CSV.

#### Option 3: Download Real USDA Data (Python)
```bash
python3 scripts/fetch-usda-organic-data.py
```

Python version of the USDA data downloader.

**After running any script:**
